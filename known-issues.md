## {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} IAM limits
{: #iam_limits}

The following table lists the maximum limits for IAM resources. These limits apply to any user who can create IAM resources. If a limit is exceeded, you receive an exception and are not allowed to create any new resources beyond that limit.
{:shortdesc}

| Resource                               | Max  |
|----------------------------------------|------|
| Access groups per account              | 500  |
| Access groups per user                 | 50   |
| Access management tags per account     | 30   |
| API Keys per identity                  | 20   |
| Cloud Foundry orgs                     | 500  |
| Custom roles per account               | 40   |
| Dynamic rules per access group         | 5    |
| Policies per account                   | 2010 |
| Policies per subject within an account | 500  |
| Policies with tags within an account   | 25   |
| Service IDs per account                | 2000 |
{:caption="Table 1. IAM account limits" caption-side="top"}

A maximum of 1,000 policies and service to service authorizations within one account is recommended to ensure optimal performance within your account. For more information about limiting the number of policies in your account, see the [Best practices for organizing resources and assigning access](/docs/account?topic=account-account_setup).
{: tip}

If you need to check the number of policies in your account or request an increase in the account limit, see [Managing policy limits](/docs/account?topic=account-policy-limits).

### Policy limitations based on attributes
{: #access-tag-limits}

Access management tags are only available when you create an access policy that is scoped for all IAM-enabled services. In this case, when you enable the access based on tags, no other attributes can be added. And, when you base your policy on a specific region or resource group, no tag can be added to the access policy.
